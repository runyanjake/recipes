    1. Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).
    2. In a large Dutch oven, cook the **bacon** over medium heat until crispy. Optionally add a small bit of water while cooking to ensure a better crisp. Remove and set aside, leaving the fat in the pot.
    3. Season the **beef** with **salt** and **pepper**, then dust with **flour**. In the same pot, brown the **beef** in batches until browned on all sides. Remove and set aside.
    4. Add the **onion** and **carrots** to the pot, cooking until softened. Stir in the **garlic** and cook for an additional minute.
    5. Return the **beef** and **bacon** to the pot. Add the **red wine**, **beef stock**, and **brandy**. Add the **bouquet garni** and bring to a simmer.
    6. Cover the pot and transfer to the oven. Cook for 2 to 3 hours, or until the **beef** is tender.
    7. In the last 30 minutes of cooking, add the **pearl onions** and **mushrooms**.
    8. Once cooked, remove from the oven, discard the **bouquet garni**, and adjust seasoning with **salt** and **pepper**.
    9. Serve hot, garnished with **fresh parsley**.
