  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Find a metal grill tray, or grill basket.
    2. Place salmon skin-side down in the grill tray/basket.
    3. Mix **mayonnaise** and **lemon pepper seasoning** in a bowl to taste.
    4. Spread the **mayo mixture** over the salmon fillets in the grill tray/basket.
    5. On a grill preheated to 400/500F, grill salmon checking frequently until internal temperature reads 145F on an instant read thermometer. Alternatively, check the thickest portion of the fillet with a fork. If flaky, salmon is done.
    6. Serve with rice, and top with pepper and the juice of a lemon for best results.
