# Grilled Lemon Pepper Salmon

:::info
Super simple! This recipe entry is more or less just a formality.
:::

```mdx title="Ingredients"
1 Salmon fillet
2 tbsp mayonnaise
1 tbsp lemon pepper seasoning (to taste)
Freshly ground pepper (to taste)
1 lemon (to taste)
```

```md title="Instructions"
1. Find a metal grill tray, or grill basket.
2. Place salmon skin-side down in the grill tray/basket.
3. Mix mayonnaise and lemon pepper seasoning in a bowl to taste.
4. Spread the mayo mixture over the salmon fillets in the grill tray/basket.
5. On a grill preheated to 400/500F, grill salmon checking frequently until internal temperature reads 145F on an instant read thermometer. Alternatively, check the thickest portion of the fillet with a fork. If flaky, salmon is done.
6. Serve with rice, and top with pepper and the juice of a lemon for best results.
```

### Notes
The lemon is a non-negotiable, really makes it the best.
