  <TabItem value="ingredients" label="Ingredients">
    ```text title="Birria"
    4 to 5 pounds chuck roast, cut into large chunks
    ½ tablespoon kosher salt
    ½ tablespoon black pepper
    1 ½ tablespoon olive oil
    12 guajillo chiles, rinsed, stemmed, and seeded
    5 ancho chiles, rinsed, stemmed, and seeded
    5 árbol chiles, rinsed and stemmed
    2 large Roma tomatoes
    ½ medium yellow onion
    1 4-inch Mexican cinnamon stick
    3 bay leaves
    ½ teaspoon whole black peppercorns
    2 cups beef broth
    ¼ cup distilled white vinegar
    5 cloves garlic
    1 teaspoon ground cumin
    1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
    ½ teaspoon ground cloves
    ```

    <Admonition type="info" title="Ingredient Sourcing">
      <p>
        My local produce store carries bags of dried chilies - whole dried are the best. 
        Purchasing online is a decent alternative for high quality chilies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, finding a decently fatty chuck roast is key for a quality consumé.

  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Season the meat with **salt** and **pepper**. Heat **olive oil** in a large pot over medium-high heat and sear the meat on all sides until browned.
    2. In a separate pot, combine **guajillo**, **ancho**, and **árbol chiles**, **tomatoes**, **onion**, **cinnamon stick**, **bay leaves**, and **peppercorns**. Cover with water and boil for 10 minutes.
    3. Transfer the softened ingredients to a blender, add 1 cup of the cooking water, **beef broth**, **vinegar**, **garlic**, **cumin**, **oregano**, and **cloves**. Blend until smooth.
    4. Strain the blended sauce into the pot with the seared meat. Stir to combine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 3-3.5 hours until the meat is tender.
    5. Shred the meat and store in a new container. Add consumé to the meat as needed to keep moist. Save the remaining consumé for another batch or for making tacos.

    <Admonition type="info" title="For the best Consumé">
      <p>
        Straining after blending is important for a smooth texture in the consumé. However, leaving it lightly chunky is not a bad thing.

    <p>Tips for Quesabirra Tacos</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use corn tortillas for a traditional flavor. Dip both sides in the consomé before hitting the stove.</li>
      <li>Right after the tortilla is placed on the stove, immediately add birria and toppings (cheese, onions, cilantro, etc.)</li>
      <li>Don't fold the tortilla until it naturally releases from the stove - this yields the best crunch.</li>
