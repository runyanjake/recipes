  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Rinse the ribs and pat them dry. If your ribs still have the thin, shiny membrane on the back, remove it.
    2. In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, paprika, black pepper, salt, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne. 
    3. Rub it all over the ribs, generously coating all of the sides.
    4. Place the trivet in the Instant Pot. Pour in the water, apple cider vinegar, and liquid smoke. 
    5. Place the ribs inside the pot, standing them on the trivet on their side and wrapping the rack around the inside of the pot like a circle.
    6. Cover and seal the Instant Pot. Cook on high pressure for 23 minutes (baby back ribs) or 35 minutes (spare ribs).
    7. While starting step 8, place a rack in the upper third of the oven and set it to broil.
    8. After the ribs finish, allow the pressure to release naturally for 5 minutes, then vent to release all of the remaining pressure.
    9. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Transfer the cooked ribs to the foil, then brush liberally with barbecue sauce.
    10. Place under the broiler just until the sauce begins to caramelize, about 2 minutes.
