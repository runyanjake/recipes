    1. Melt the **butter** in a small pot over low-medium heat. Whisk in the **flour** and allow to cook for about a minute or two, while whisking. 
    2. Pour in 1/2 cup of the **pan juices** and whisk until it forms a paste. Add remaining liquid in 1/2 cup increments, whisking in between, until the gravy is smooth. 
    3. Allow to simmer over medium heat until thickened. Take off heat, stir in **worcestershire sauce** and season with **salt** and **pepper** (if needed). The gravy will continue to thicken as it cools.
