# Turkey Gravy 

:::info
This stuff is amazing... and full of fat...
:::

```mdx title="Ingredients"
2 1/4 - 2 1/2 cups pan juices (top up with chicken stock if needed)
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper (if needed)
```

```md title="Instructions"
1. Melt the butter in a small pot over low-medium heat. Whisk in the flour and allow to cook for about a minute or two, while whisking. 
2. Pour in 1/2 cup of the pan juices and whisk until it forms a paste. Add remaining liquid in 1/2 cup increments, whisking in between, until the gravy is smooth. 
3. Allow to simmer over medium heat until thickened. Take off heat, stir in worcestershire sauce and season with salt and pepper (if needed). The gravy will continue to thicken as it cools.

### Notes
Make sure to scoop up both drippings and fat when gathering the pan juices. All are important!
