  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Lower oven shelf to the lowest part of your oven.
    2. Combine the **Herb Butter ingredients** in a bowl and mix well. Reserve half of the herb butter in the refrigerator for later.
    3. Line a large roasting pan with foil or parchment paper. Arrange the 4 halves of **garlic** cut-side down on the bottom of the pan with 4 sprigs each of **thyme** and **rosemary**, half of the **olive oil** and 1 slice of **lemon**.
    4. Thoroughly pat turkey dry with paper towels. Stuff with the remaining heads **garlic halves**, **lemon slice**, a squeeze of lemon from remaining slice, **herbs** and a drizzle of **olive oil**. 
    5. Melt the **butter** and rub all over the turkey, including under the skin. Season generously all over with **salt** and **pepper**. Place turkey on top of the garlic and herbs in the pan BREAST-SIDE DOWN. Drizzle with the remaining **oil**.
    6. Roast uncovered for 30 minutes for a small turkey under 13 pounds (6 1/2 kg), or 45 minutes for a larger turkey over 14 pounds (7 kg plus).
    7. Turn turkey over (breast-side up) with a pair of tongs, a clean tea towel or oven mitts and baste with pan juices.
    8. Spread half of the reserved **herb butter** over the top of your turkey with a spoon or brush. Pour any remaining juices over your turkey.
    9. Reduce heat to 325°F. Roast, uncovered, for an hour.
    10. Slather turkey generously with remaining **butter** and roast for 30 minutes. Baste again, then continue roasting for a further 30 minutes or so, depending on the size of your bird. Tent loosely with foil if starting to brown too fast. For an extra large turkey, you may need an additional half hour to an hour.
    11. For extra crispy skin, broil or grill in the last 5-10 minutes, keeping your eye on it so it doesn't burn, until the skin is crispy and golden browned all over.
    12. Tent turkey with foil and allow it to rest for 20-30 minutes before carving and serving.
    13. Remove 2 1/2 cups of the liquid from the **pan juices** (top up with stock if you need too), strain and reserve for your gravy (see below). 

    <Admonition type="info" title="Keep it Together">
      <p>It's hard to get perfect cuts on the garlic. I found success by lightly sawing with a sharpened knife. When squeezing the garlic out try not to burn yourself.</p>

  <TabItem value="carving" label="Carving">
    1. Remove the legs first by cutting through the skin between the body and the leg, then pull the leg away from the body and cut through the joint.
    2. Separate the thigh from the drumstick by locating the joint between them and cutting through it.
    3. Remove the wings by pulling them away from the body and cutting through the joint where they meet the breast.
    4. For the breast meat:
        - Find the breastbone in the middle of the turkey
        - Make a horizontal cut along one side of it
        - Continue cutting downward, following the rib cage
        - Slice the breast meat against the grain into serving portions
    5. Remove any remaining meat from the carcass.
    
    <Admonition type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
      <p>Let the turkey rest for at least 20-30 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute and makes carving easier.</p>
