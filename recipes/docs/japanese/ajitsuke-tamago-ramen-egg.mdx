  <TabItem value="ingredients" label="Ingredients">
    ```text title="Ajitsuke Tamago (Ramen Egg)"
    Eggs
    2 tablespoons white vinegar
    ¼ cup soy sauce
    ¼ cup mirin cooking wine
    1 teaspoon brown sugar
    ```

    <Admonition type="info" title="Tight Fit">
      <p>Make sure to find a bowl that can just barely fit all the eggs together, the sauce has to cover all of them.</p>

  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Bring a pot of enough water to cover the eggs to a boil once added.
    2. Place saucepan over high heat and add vinegar to help with peeling. Bring to a boil.
    3. Prick a hole in the wide end of each egg (helps with shape and peeling).
    4. Gently lower the eggs into the water.
    5. Set a timer for 6-7 minutes, depending on the target consistency.
    6. Pick out the eggs and set into cold or ice water.
    7. Peel shells and lower into the marinade. 
    8. Chill 1-4 (or more) hours.
    9. When serving, remove from marinade and cut in half.

    <Admonition type="info" title="To Age or Not to Age">
      <p>Depending on how long you age these, they'll get really salty. A few days is a good middle ground, after that you can take the eggs out and store seperately.</p>
