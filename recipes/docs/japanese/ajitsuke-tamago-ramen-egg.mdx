# Ajitsuke Tamago (Ramen Egg)

:::info
You can use as many eggs as possible, so long as there is enough space in the marinating container for the eggs to be completely covered.
:::

```mdx title="Ingredients"
Eggs
2 tablespoons white vinegar
¼ cup soy sauce
¼ cup mirin cooking wine
1 teaspoon brown sugar
```

```md title="Instructions"
1. Bring a pot of enough water to cover the eggs to a boil once added.
2. Place saucepan over high heat and add vinegar to help with peeling. Bring to a boil.
3. Prick a hole in the wide end of each egg (helps with shape and peeling).
4. Gently lower the eggs into the water.
5. Set a timer for 6-7 minutes, depending on the target consistency.
6. Pick out the eggs and set into cold or ice water.
7. Peel shells and lower into the marinade. 
8. Chill 1-4 (or more) hours.
9. When serving, remove from marinade and cut in half.
```

### Notes
If some eggs don't peel right, cook them a bit more and make egg salad!
