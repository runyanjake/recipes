    ## Ingredients
    ```text title="Ingredients"
    2 tablespoons vegetable oil
    1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
    1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
    2 cups chicken broth
    1 teaspoon salt
    1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
    1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

    1. Heat the **vegetable oil** in a large saucepan or skillet with a lid over medium heat.
    2. Add the **rice** and cook, stirring constantly, until the grains are lightly golden brown. This toasting step is key for flavor and texture.
    3. Carefully stir in the **tomato sauce**, **chicken broth**, **salt**, **cumin**, **garlic powder**, and **chili powder**.
    4. Bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan tightly, and let it simmer.
    5. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the rice is tender and all the liquid has been absorbed. Avoid lifting the lid while it simmers.
    6. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Serving Suggestion">
      <p>
        This rice is the perfect accompaniment to tacos, burritos, enchiladas, or any grilled meat. Garnish with fresh cilantro for extra flavor and color.
