    ## Ingredients
    ```text title="Ingredients"
    6-8 medium ears of corn, husks removed
    1/2 cup mayonnaise
    1/2 cup Mexican crema or sour cream
    1/2 cup finely crumbled cotija cheese, plus more for serving
    1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro
    1 medium clove garlic, minced
    1/2 teaspoon chili powder (ancho or guajillo recommended), plus more for serving
    1 lime, cut into wedges
    ```

    <Admonition type="info" title="Cheese Selection">
      <p>
        Cotija is a salty, crumbly Mexican cheese. If you can't find it, a dry feta or even grated Parmesan can be used as a substitute, though the flavor will be slightly different.

  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Preheat a grill to medium-high heat.
    2. While the grill heats, prepare the sauce. In a medium bowl, combine the **mayonnaise**, **crema** (or sour cream), 1/2 cup of **cotija cheese**, minced **cilantro**, **garlic**, and 1/2 teaspoon of **chili powder**. Mix well until combined.
    3. Grill the **corn**, turning occasionally, until it's cooked through and charred in spots, which should take about 10 minutes.
    4. Once the corn is grilled, immediately brush a generous layer of the creamy sauce mixture onto all sides of each cob.
    5. Sprinkle the coated corn with additional **cotija cheese** and a dusting of **chili powder**.
    6. Serve immediately with **lime** wedges for squeezing over the corn just before eating.

      <p>
        You can achieve a similar result by broiling the corn in your oven or carefully charring it over a gas stove flame. Be sure to turn it frequently for even cooking and char.
