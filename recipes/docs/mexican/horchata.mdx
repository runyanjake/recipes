    ## Ingredients
    ```text title="Ingredients"
    1 cup uncooked white rice
    2 cinnamon sticks
    12 oz can evaporated milk
    12 oz can sweetened condensed milk
    8 cups warm water, divided
    Sugar to taste
    Ground cinnamon, for garnish (optional)
    1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
    ```

    <Admonition type="info" title="Soaking">
      <p>
        It is worth the time to soak the cinnamon and rice, helping you pull out more flavor and end with a product that is less lightly flavored water and more of a thicker drink.

  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Rinse the **rice** under cold water. In a bowl, combine **rice**, **cinnamon sticks**, and 4 cups of **warm water**. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.
    2. Remove most of the **cinnamon sticks**, leaving a few small pieces.
    3. Blend the soaked mixture in two batches until very smooth, about 3–4 minutes per batch.
    4. Pour through a fine‑mesh strainer or cheesecloth into a pitcher, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Repeat with the remaining batch.
    5. Stir in the **evaporated milk**, **sweetened condensed milk**, **vanilla** (if using), and the remaining 4 cups **water**. Adjust sweetness with **sugar** to taste.
    6. Chill thoroughly, then stir and serve over ice. Garnish with **ground cinnamon**, if desired.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Blending">
      <p>
        Heed the instructions and blend in batches. Water easily escapes from the blender or food processor and this stuff gets everywhere.
