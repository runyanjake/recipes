    <Admonition type="info" title="About the Roux">
      <p>
        A dark roux adds deep flavor but can burn easily. Stir constantly over low heat.

  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. In a large dutch oven, heat **vegetable oil** over low heat. Add **flour** and stir essentially constantly until the roux becomes dark brown. This can take between 30-60 mins depending on the stove. 
    2. Place the dutch oven with the finished roux over medium heat and add **celery**, **onion**, and **bell pepper**. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until the vegetables have softened and the **onions** are translucent.
    3. Add the **garlic** and **creole seasoning** and cook for about 1 minute or until the **garlic** is fragrant.
    4. Gradually add **chicken stock**, **bay leaves**, and **thyme** and undrained **tomatoes**. Stir to combine. Add **salt**, **pepper**, and additional **creole seasoning** to taste. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook uncovered for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    5. At the same time, in a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of **oil**, add the sliced **sausage** and brown.
    6. Once the gumbo has simmered, add the cooked **sausage** and shredded **chicken**. Stir to combine. 
    7. Add the **okra** and simmer uncovered for an additional 30 to 45 minutes or until thickened. 
    8. Add additional **broth**, if desired. Spoon away any excess grease that may accumulate on the top. Remove the **bay leaves**.
    9. Once cooked, remove from the heat and stir in the **shrimp**. The hot stock will cook the **shrimp** through in about 5 minutes.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Keeping the Roux from Burning">
      <p>
        Every 15 seconds or so precipitate will form in the roux, which you need to scrape off the bottom. A whisk is a pretty good tool for this.

        If bits get stuck to the bottom, they will burn and the roux will be ruined; you can confirm this by tasting it.

        The roux should be a dark brown color and have a nutty aroma.
