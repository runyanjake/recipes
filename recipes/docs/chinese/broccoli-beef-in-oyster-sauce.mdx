```mdx title="Ingredients"
300g beef (2 half-inch cuts of beef)
Broccoli (a large head or as much as desired)
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 clove of garlic, chopped
2 teaspoons of diced ginger
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
```

```md title="Instructions"
1. Chop the beef into thin, long, bite-sized strips. Place in a bowl that can hold the beef and the rest of the marinade.
2. Add a pinch of salt, sugar, vegetable oil, sodium bicarbonate, corn starch, rice wine, and ginger to the bowl with the beef.
3. Give the marinade a good mix and leave in the fridge for at least 60 minutes.
4. Chop the broccoli into manageable pieces and bring a pot of salted water to a boil. 
5. Blanch the broccoli quickly and drain it from the water. Don't leave it too long or you'll lose the crunch.
6. Put vegetable oil into a wok over high heat.
7. Add the garlic and ginger and immediately add in the beef before they burn. 
8. Layer the beef in a single layer and sear to develop a crust. Then stir fry until golden brown.
9. Add broccoli along with the oyster sauce. Stir through to coat.
10. Turn the heat down to low
11. Mix the cornflour slurry ingredients and add it to the wok. Gradually turn the heat back to medium as you stir fry. Continue until the sauce thickens and becomes translucent.
