    The classic egg drop soup. Tastes pretty similar to the store, and super easy to make!

    1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
    3/4 teaspoon salt
    1/8 teaspoon sugar
    1/8 teaspoon while pepper
    3 tablespoons cornstarch
    1/3 cup water (to mix with cornstarch)
    3 eggs lightly beaten

      <p>It's pretty good regardless of the exact ratios. Also I'm a fan of excess pepper when sick.</p>

  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Bring the **chicken stock** to a simmer in a pot.
    2. Stir in **sesame oil**, **salt**, **sugar**, **white pepper**. Adjust to taste at this point.
    3. If using, also stir in the **msg**, **cooking wine**, and **turmeric**.
    4. Mix the **cornstarch** and **water** together to make a slurry.
    5. Before the solution settles, stir the soup continuously and drizzle in the **slurry** until the soup is the desired thickness.
    6. Lightly beat the **egg** so that the egg and yolk don't completely mix together.
    7. Stir with a ladle and slowly drizzle in the egg, making ribbons in the soup. 
    8. Top with **scallions** and extra **white pepper** if desired.

      <p>
        Stir SLOWLY when adding in the egg for the best results. Stirring quickly yields a pretty homogenous result. 
        Also give the cooking wine addition a try (thanks, mom)
