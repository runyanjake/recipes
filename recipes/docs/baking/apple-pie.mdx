# Apple Pie

:::info
A frozen pie shell stacked on top will melt into a good covering if you don't want to make a nice top for the pie.
:::

```mdx title="Ingredients - Egg Wash"
1 large egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon milk
```

```mdx title="Ingredients - Pie"
2 pie crusts, homemade or store bought (1 for bottom and 1 for top)
10 cups 1/4-inch-thick apple slices (about 8 large peeled and cored apples)
1/2 cup granulated sugar or packed brown sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Coarse sugar for sprinkling on crust (optional)
```

```md title="Instructions"
1. Prep pie crust if making from scrath. Keep prepared or store-bought pie crust chilled untill using.
2. Stir the apple slices, sugar, flour, lemon juice, cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg together until thoroughly combined.
3. (Optional) Pre-cook the apples by pouring into a very large skillet/dutch oven, and place over medium-low heat. Stir and cook for 5 minutes until the apples begin to soften. Remove from heat and set aside.
4. Preheat oven to 400°F.
5. On a floured work surface, roll out one of the discs of chilled dough (keep the other one in the refrigerator). Turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls until you have a circle 12 inches in diameter. Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch pie dish that’s 1.5 to 2 inches deep. Tuck the dough in with your fingers, making sure it is smooth. 
6. Spoon the filling into the crust. It’s ok if it is still warm from the precooking step. It will seem like a lot of apples; that’s ok. Pile them high, and tightly together.
7. Remove the other disc of chilled pie dough from the refrigerator. Roll the dough into a circle that is 12 inches diameter. Cover the pie in a lattice design or whatever the intended pattern is. Use a small paring knife or kitchen shears to trim off excess dough. Fold the overhang back towards the center of the pie, and pinch the edges to adhere the top and bottom crusts together. Crimp or flute the pie crust edges to seal.
8. Lightly brush the top of the pie crust with the egg wash. Sprinkle the top with coarse sugar, if using.
9. Place the pie onto a large baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes. 
10. Keeping the pie in the oven, reduce the oven temperature down to 375°F. Place a pie crust shield (or cover edges with tinfoil) on the edges to prevent them from over-browning. 
11. Continue baking the pie until the filling is bubbling around the edges, 35–40 more minutes. The internal temperature of the filling should be around 200°F (93°C) when done.
12. Remove pie from the oven, place on a cooling rack, and cool for at least 3 hours before slicing and serving. Filling will be too juicy if the pie is warm when you slice it.
​​13. Cover and store leftover pie at room temperature for up to 1 day or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
