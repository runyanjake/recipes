# Caesar Salad Dressing

:::info
Anchovy fillets or anchovy paste both work well. If using fillets make sure to smash to de-bone as much as possible.
:::

```mdx title="Ingredients"
2 small garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp anchovy paste or 2 fillets
1 tsp dijon mustard
1 tsp worcestershire sauce
1 cup mayonnaise (use less for a thinner dressing)
1/2 cup parmigiano-reggiano
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
```

```md title="Instructions"
1. 
```

### Notes
Use less mayo for a thinner sauce. I'm not a huge fan of the mayo taste, and using less helps with the taste.
