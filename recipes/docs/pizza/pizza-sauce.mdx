# Pizza Sauce

:::info
Avoid excess salt as this doesn't really need it.
:::

```md title="Ingredients"
6 oz tomato paste
15 oz tomato sauce
1-2 tablespoons dried oregano to taste
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ tablespoon garlic salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon sugar
```

```md title="Instructions - Dough (using dry active yeast)"
1. Mix tomato paste and sauce together in a medium size bowl until smooth.
2. Add the rest of the ingredients – oregano, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, garlic salt, pepper and sugar – and stir until evenly distributed throughout the sauce.
3. Taste and adjust seasonings to your liking.
```

### Notes
A decently sweet sauce usually breaks up the salt you'll be adding in meat-related toppings.
