# Pizza Dough

:::info
Recipe makes about 4 medium size pizza doughs. Each should cover most of a pizza spatula and fit nicely on a normal size pizza steel.  
:::

```md title="Ingredients"
1 cup warm water (temperature depends on type of yeast, usually 100-110 degrees Fahrenheit)
2 ¼ teaspoons dry active yeast (1 normal sized packet)
½ teaspoon granulated sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 cups all-purpose flour (approximate)
```

```md title="Instructions - Dough (using dry active yeast)"
1. Measure warm water (between 100°-110°F) in a measuring cup, then add the yeast and sugar. Stir gently, then let sit around 5 minutes until it’s active and foamy. This will happen within 5 minutes. Use a thermometer to measure water temp.
2. Stir salt, oil, and 2 cups flour in a large mixing bowl, stirring in the yeast mixture as you go, using a wooden spoon. 
3. Add the third cup of flour and then stir until you can’t anymore. Remove the spoon and then use your hands to work the dough into a ball that is slightly sticky.
4. Spray a second large bowl with nonstick cooking spray, add your pizza dough ball, then spray the top lightly with cooking spray and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place in a warm area of the kitchen and let rise until doubled in size, about 1-2 hours.
```

```md title="Instructions - Making Pizza with this Dough"
1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a pizza steel inside. (Use a stone if you have one but your mileage may vary.)
2. Cook for around 10 mins for thorough cook of a thin crust pizza.
```

### Notes
Good yeast is the secret here. From a packet is better than keeping bulk usually.
