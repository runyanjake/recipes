  <TabItem value="ingredients" label="Ingredients">
    ```text title="Pizza Dough"
    1 cup warm water (temperature depends on type of yeast, usually 100-110 degrees Fahrenheit)
    2 ¼ teaspoons dry active yeast (1 normal sized packet)
    ½ teaspoon granulated sugar
    1 teaspoon salt
    3 tablespoons olive oil
    3 cups all-purpose flour (approximate)
    ```

    <Admonition type="info" title="Family Sized">
      <p>Recipe makes about 4 medium sized pizza doughs. Each would cover most of a pizza spatula as a thinner crust.</p>

  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Measure **warm water** (between 100°-110°F) in a measuring cup, then add the **yeast** and **sugar**. Stir gently, then let sit around 5 minutes until it’s active and foamy. This will happen within 5 minutes. Use a thermometer to measure water temp.
    2. Stir **salt**, **oil**, and 2 cups **flour** in a large mixing bowl, stirring in the yeast mixture as you go, using a wooden spoon. 
    3. Add the third cup of **flour** and then stir until you can’t anymore. Remove the spoon and then use your hands to work the dough into a ball that is slightly sticky.
    4. Spray a second large bowl with nonstick cooking spray, add your pizza dough ball, then spray the top lightly with cooking spray and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place in a warm area of the kitchen and let rise until doubled in size, about 1-2 hours.

    
    <Admonition type="info" title="Yeast Quality">
      <p>Good yeast is the secret here. From a packet is better than keeping bulk usually. Either way, the more bubbles the better.</p>
