# Pizza Dough

:::info
Recipe makes about 4 medium size pizza doughs. Each should cover most of a pizza spatula and fit nicely on a normal size pizza steel.  
:::

```md title="Ingredients"
Â¼ cup olive oil
```

```md title="Instructions - Dough"
1. Heat 2 cups of water to between 100 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit. 
```

```md title="Instructions - Pizza"
1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a pizza steel inside. (Use a stone if you have one but your mileage may vary.)
```

### Notes
Lasts quite a while, but reheat quality is not super presentable because of the heavy cream.
