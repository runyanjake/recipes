# Vodka Pasta

:::info
Recipe makes about a pound of pasta, in my experience that ends up being about 8 large servings. 
:::

```mdx title="Ingredients"
¼ cup olive oil
½ shallot, finely chopped
1 small garlic clove, finely grated
½ cup tomato paste
2 tablespoons vodka
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
1 pound fusilli
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 ounce finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving
¼ cup chopped fresh basil"
```

```md title="Instructions"
1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. 
2. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.
3. Begin cooking pasta in salted water until al dente. This can be done while working on the next few steps for the pasta in parallel.
4. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until paste is brick red and starts to caramelize, about 5 minutes.
5. Add vodka and cook, stirring constantly, until liquid is mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes. 
6. Add cream and red pepper flakes and stir until well blended. 
7. Season with salt and pepper & remove from heat.
8. The pasta should be finished at this point. Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water.
9. Add pasta to skillet with sauce along with butter and ½ cup pasta cooking liquid. 
10. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly and adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed, until butter has melted and a thick, glossy sauce has formed, about 2 minutes. 
11. Season with salt and pepper and add 1 oz. Parmesan, tossing to coat. Divide pasta among bowls, then top with basil and more Parmesan.

### Notes
Lasts quite a while, but reheat quality is not super presentable because of the heavy cream.
