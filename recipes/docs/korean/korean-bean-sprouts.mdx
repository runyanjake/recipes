    ## Ingredients
    ```text title="Ingredients"
    1 pound mung bean sprouts (soybean ok but not ideal)
    1 head garlic, minced
    1 tablespoon sesame oil
    1 tablespoon soy sauce
    1 teaspoon fish sauce (or salt)
    2 stalks green onions, chopped
    1 tablespoon sesame seeds
    ```

    <Admonition type="warning" title="Mung vs Soybean">
      <p>
        Traditionally this dish is made using mung bean sprouts. However on the mainland those can be hard to find, so soybean sprouts can be used instead.

    1. Rinse **bean sprouts** under cold running water several times. Discard browned sprouts and remove stringy root ends if desired. Drain and set aside.
    2. Bring a pot of water to a boil with a pinch of salt. Add all **bean sprouts**, cover with lid, and cook on medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Keep the lid on throughout cooking.
    3. Drain immediately and place cooked sprouts in a mixing bowl.
    4. Add minced **garlic**, **sesame oil**, **soy sauce**, **fish sauce**, chopped **green onions**, and **sesame seeds** to the bowl.
    5. Toss and mix well, preferably by hand with a glove.

    <Admonition type="warning" title="Keep the Lid On">
      <p>
        Keep the lid on the pot during boiling to prevent a fishy flavor from developing.
