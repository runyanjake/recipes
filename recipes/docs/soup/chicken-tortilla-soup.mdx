  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    **Tortillas**
    1. Heat **neutral oil** in a medium Dutch oven or pot over medium heat until shimmering. Line a plate with paper towels.
    2. Working in batches, fry the **corn tortillas**, stirring and flipping frequently, until crisp and light golden-brown, for **45 to 60 seconds**. Make sure the centers are not chewy.
    3. Transfer the tortilla strips to the plate. Sprinkle lightly with **kosher salt**, about 2-3 turns. Add more oil as needed.

    **Soup**
    1. Discard all but 3 tablespoons of the **oil** from the pot (do not strain out broken bits of fried tortilla). Return to medium-high heat.
    2. Add the diced **yellow onion**, diced **poblano peppers**, grated **garlic cloves**, and chopped **cilantro stems**.
    3. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened and browned in spots, about **8 minutes**.
    4. Stir in the **ancho chili**, **cumin**, **oregano**, and 1 teaspoon **kosher salt**. Cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about **1 minute**.
    5. Stir in the **chicken broth**, **shredded chicken**, **corn kernels**, **crushed tomatoes**, and **water**.
    6. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the flavors meld, **15 to 20 minutes**.
    7. Serve with **lime wedges**, **kosher salt**, reserved **tortilla strips**, and **cilantro leaves**.
