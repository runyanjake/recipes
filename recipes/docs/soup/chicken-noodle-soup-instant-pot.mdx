    A great soup for rainy or sick days. Doesn't actually have to be cooked in the Instant Pot.

  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Turn your Instant Pot to the saute setting.
    2. Add the **butter** and cook until the butter has melted. Add the **onion**, **carrots** and **celery** and saute for 3 minutes until the onion softens and becomes translucent.
    3. Season with **salt** and **pepper**, add the **thyme**, **parsley**, **oregano**, **chicken bouillon** and stir.
    4. Pour in the **chicken broth**. Add the **chicken pieces** and add another 4 cups of **water**. 
    5. Close the lid. Set the Instant Pot to the Soup setting and set the timer to 7 minutes on high pressure.
    6. Once the Instant Pot cycle is complete, wait until the natural release cycle is complete and open the instant pot.
    7. Remove the chicken pieces from the soup and shred with two forks.
    8. Add the **noodles** to the soup and set the Instant Pot to the saute setting again. Cook for another 6 minutes uncovered, or until the noodles are cooked. 
    9. Turn off the Instant Pot. Add the shredded chicken back to the Instant Pot, taste for seasoning and adjust as necessary. Garnish with additional parsley if preferred.
    
    <Admonition type="info" title="Meal Prep">
      <p>If doing meal prep and using a lot of noodles/macaroni, they tend to soak up a lot of the water/broth. Double the water and broth amounts if you want it to keep in the fridge and retain some broth, versus becoming more of a soup-cassarole.</p>

    <Admonition type="info" title="Don't Oversalt">
      <p>Watch the amount of salt in this, pretty easy to over-salt if you're not careful.</p>
