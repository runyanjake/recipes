# Instant Pot Chicken Noodle Soup

:::info
Recipe can make nearly a whole week of soup. Double it if you're feeling dangerous. 
:::

```mdx title="Ingredients"
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 large onion (chopped)
2 medium carrots (chopped)
2 stalks celery (chopped)
Kosher salt, fresh ground pepper
1 teaspoon thyme
1 tablespoon parsley
1 tablespoon oregano
1 chicken bouillon (cube or powder)
4 cups chicken broth
2 pounds chicken (usually one safeway or costco chicken)
4 cups water
2 cups uncooked egg noodles
```

```md title="Instructions"
1. Turn your Instant Pot to the saute setting.
2. Add the butter and cook until the butter has melted. Add the onion, carrots and celery and saute for 3 minutes until the onion softens and becomes translucent.
3. Season with salt and pepper, add the thyme, parsley, oregano, chicken bouillon and stir.
4. Pour in the chicken broth. Add the chicken pieces and add another 4 cups of water. 
5. Close the lid. Set the Instant Pot to the Soup setting and set the timer to 7 minutes on high pressure.
6. Once the Instant Pot cycle is complete, wait until the natural release cycle is complete and open the instant pot.
7. Remove the chicken pieces from the soup and shred with two forks.
8. Add the noodles to the soup and set the Instant Pot to the saute setting again. Cook for another 6 minutes uncovered, or until the noodles are cooked. 
9. Turn off the Instant Pot. Add the shredded chicken back to the Instant Pot, taste for seasoning and adjust as necessary. Garnish with additional parsley if preferred.
```

### Notes
Watch the amount of salt in this, pretty easy to over-salt if you're not careful.
