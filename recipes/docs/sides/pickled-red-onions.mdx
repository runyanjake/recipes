# Pickled Red Onions

:::info
Mix additionally after bottling to ensure proper coverage.
:::

```mdx title="Ingredients"
1 large red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced
3/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup water
1 teaspoon fine sea salt
1â€“2 tablespoons sweetener (maple syrup, honey, or sugar)
```

```md title="Instructions"
1. Mix the vinegar, water, salt, and sweetener in a heated saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until simmering. Microwave works as well.
2. Stuff thinly-sliced onions into a jar or container with a lid. You can get way more in there than you think if you really stuff them.
3. Pour the hot vinegar mixture over the onions and seal. Shake briefly to ensure full coverage. You can additionally shake periodically if you want.
4. Marinate for as little as 30 minutes and up to 2 weeks before consuming. You can press onions down with a spoon to submerge after a while if they stick out of the liquid. 
```

### Notes
Add some spices for extra taste - People recommend celery salt.
