    ```text title="Sous Vide Garlic Mashed Potatoes"
    3 lbs Yukon Gold potatoes (or enough cubed to fill 2/3 of a gallon ziploc bag)
    2 tbsp / 1/2 oz unsalted butter
    1/4 - 1/2 cup cream cheese (alternate: sour cream)
    1/2 tsp garlic powder

  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Cube the **potatoes**, optionally leaving the skin on. Optionally soak in water to get the starch out.
    2. Load the potatoes into a sous vide bag. Fill it up no more than 3/4 of the way full, ideally closer to 1/2.
    3. Add the **butter**, **cream cheese**/**sour cream**, **garlic powder**, **salt**, **pepper*, **rosemary**, and **milk** to the bag.
    4. Seal the sous vide bag by holding underwater and letting air escape.
    5. Using the sous vide cooker, heat water to no more than 195 degrees. Ziploc bags break down past that point. Actual sous vide bags can handle the temperature.
    6. Cook for 2 hours or until the potatoes can be squished by hand.
    7. Take bags out of the water and let cool for 10 minutes.
    8. Hand mash in the bag, or pour into a bowl and use forks.
    9. Pour/plate into bowl. Sprinkle with garnish if available.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Don't Poke the Bag!">
      <p>The only way to mess up is to create a hole in the bag. The easiest way to do this is by allowing the rosemary sprig to puncture the bag. Make sure to chop up the rosemary before putting in the bag.</p>
