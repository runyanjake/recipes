  <TabItem value="ingredients" label="Ingredients">
    ```text title="Cauliflower Mash"
    1 large head cauliflower, cut into florets (about 2 to 2.5 lb)
    2 tablespoons unsalted butter (or olive oil)
    2 cloves garlic, minced (or 1 teaspoon garlic powder)
    2 ounces cream cheese (about 1/4 cup) or 1/4 cup sour cream/Greek yogurt
    1/4 to 1/2 cup milk or heavy cream, warmed
    1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan (optional)
    Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
    Chives or parsley, finely chopped (optional, for garnish)
    ```

    <Admonition type="info" title="Drain Well">
      <p>Waterlogged cauliflower makes a loose mash. After cooking, let the florets steam‑dry and drive off moisture for a fluffier, creamier texture.</p>

  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Trim and cut the **cauliflower** into medium florets.
    2. Cook until very tender: steam 10–12 minutes (preferred) or boil 8–10 minutes. The florets should crush easily with tongs.
    3. Drain thoroughly in a colander and let steam‑dry 3–5 minutes. For extra dryness, return to the empty pot over low heat for 1–2 minutes, stirring.
    4. In a small pan, melt **butter** and gently cook the **garlic** 1–2 minutes until fragrant (do not brown). Skip if using garlic powder.
    5. In a food processor or with an immersion blender, combine the hot **cauliflower**, melted **butter/garlic**, **cream cheese** (or sour cream/yogurt), and half of the **milk/cream**. Blend until smooth and silky, scraping as needed.
    6. Add **Parmesan** (if using), **salt**, and **pepper**. Pulse to combine. Adjust thickness with more warm **milk/cream**. Taste and season.
    7. Transfer to a bowl, garnish with **chives/parsley**, and serve hot.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Make It Yours">
      <p>For ultra‑smooth mash, strain through a fine sieve. For dairy‑free, use olive oil and unsweetened almond milk. Add‑ins: roasted garlic, horseradish, or a spoon of sour cream for tang.</p>
