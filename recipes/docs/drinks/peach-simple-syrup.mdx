    ## Ingredients
    ```text title="Ingredients"
    1 cup peaches (about 2 medium), fresh or frozen, chopped
    1 cup sugar (unrefined cane, granulated, or brown)
    1 cup water
    1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
    ```

    <Admonition type="info" title="Sugar Choice">
      <p>
        Unrefined cane sugar is a great choice, but regular granulated white sugar or even brown sugar will also work well. Brown sugar will result in a slightly darker syrup with a hint of caramel flavor.

  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Wash and chop the **peaches** into small pieces. There's no need to peel them.
    2. In a medium saucepan, combine the chopped **peaches**, **sugar**, and **water**.
    3. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the **sugar** is fully dissolved.
    4. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer gently for 15-20 minutes. Use a spoon or potato masher to gently mash the **peaches** to release more flavor.
    5. Turn off the heat and allow the syrup to steep and cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes. The longer it steeps, the more flavorful it will be.
    6. Pour the syrup through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean jar or bottle. Press the peach pulp with a spoon to extract all the liquid.
    7. If using, stir in the **vanilla extract** once the syrup has been strained.
    8. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
