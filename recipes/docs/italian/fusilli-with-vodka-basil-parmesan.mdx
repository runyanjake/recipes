  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. Heat **oil** in a large skillet over medium. 
    2. Add **shallot** and **garlic** and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.
    3. Begin cooking **pasta** in salted water until al dente. This can be done while working on the next few steps for the pasta in parallel.
    4. Add **tomato paste** and cook, stirring occasionally, until paste is brick red and starts to caramelize, about 5 minutes.
    5. Add **vodka** and cook, stirring constantly, until liquid is mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes. 
    6. Add **cream** and **red pepper flakes** and stir until well blended. 
    7. Season with **salt** and **pepper** & remove from heat.
    8. The pasta should be finished at this point. Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of the **pasta water**.
    9. Add pasta to skillet with sauce along with **butter** and ½ cup **pasta cooking liquid**. 
    10. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly and adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed, until butter has melted and a thick, glossy sauce has formed, about 2 minutes. 
    11. Season with salt and pepper and add 1 oz. **Parmesan**, tossing to coat. Divide pasta among bowls, then top with basil and more Parmesan.

      <p>Lasts quite a while, but reheat quality is not super presentable because of the heavy cream.</p>
