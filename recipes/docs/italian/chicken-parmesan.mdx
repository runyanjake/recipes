    **Preparation**
    1. Pre-heat oven to **350°F**.
    2. Place one **chicken breast** inside a gallon size ziplock bag. Using a kitchen mallet, pound the chicken breast to an even size, approximately **½ inch** thick. Repeat for the remaining breasts.

    **Breading**
    1. Prepare three shallow trays. In the first tray, place the **flour** and season with **salt and pepper**.
    2. In a small bowl, beat **eggs** with the **cream**. Pour this egg wash into the second tray. Add **salt**, **pepper** and **half of the minced parsley** to the egg wash.
    3. In the third tray, place the **breadcrumbs** and mix in the **parmesan cheese**.
    4. To bread, dredge each cutlet in the **flour** on both sides, dip in the **egg wash**, and finally cover completely with **breadcrumbs**. Set aside and finish breading all cutlets.

    **Frying**
    1. Heat **olive oil** in a large skillet until very hot. Ensure this will cover about half of the chicken when placed in the skillet.
    2. Cook two cutlets at a time, turning when they start to get a golden color. They will cook fast on the outside; they will finish cooking in the oven.
    3. Drain fried cutlets on a paper towel and finish frying the rest of the cutlets.

    **Bake & Serve**
    1. Add 4 big spoonfuls of **marinara sauce** to the bottom of a large lasagna or baking pan. Alternatively place a spoonful on each piece of chicken. Avoid using too much or the final result will be soupy.
    2. Arrange the cutlets in a single layer or slightly overlapping.
    3. Add a spoonful of **marinara sauce** over each cutlet and around the sides.
    4. Sprinkle the **mozzarella cheese** over the cutlets, and finish with the rest of the **flat leaf parsley**.
    5. Bake for **25-35 minutes** until the cheese is starting to turn golden brown.
    6. Serve immediately.

      <p>It's difficult to sub cheese in this recipe but using a low fat mozzarella cheese makes it a slight bit healthier.</p>
