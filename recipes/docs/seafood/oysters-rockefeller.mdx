    4. Add **spinach** and cook until wilted (about 1 minute).
    5. Stir in **parsley**, **Pernod**, **breadcrumbs**, and **Parmesan**. Season with **salt** and **cayenne** to taste.
    6. Nestle the oyster shells in the rock salt to keep them level.
    7. Top each **oyster** with the spinach mixture.
    8. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the edges of the oysters begin to curl and the topping is lightly browned.
    9. Serve immediately with **lemon wedges**.

    <Admonition type="tip" title="Shucking Tips">
      <p>Use a proper oyster knife and thick glove. Insert the knife at the hinge and twist to pop the shell. Clean the knife between each oyster.</p>
    </Admonition>

    <Admonition type="caution" title="Temperature">
      <p>Oysters should be kept cold (below 40°F) until ready to prepare. Once cooked, serve immediately.</p>
