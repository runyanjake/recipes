  <TabItem value="instructions" label="Instructions">
    1. In a bowl, combine **chicken** with all of the ingredients for the **chicken marinade**; let marinate for 10 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).
    2. Heat **oil** in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add **marinated chicken pieces** in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)
    3. Melt the **butter** in the same pan. Fry the **onions** until soft (about 3 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. 
    4. Add **garlic** and **ginger** and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add **garam masala**, **cumin**, **turmeric** and **coriander**. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.
    5. Pour in the **tomato puree**, **chili powders** and **salt**. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.
    6. Stir the **cream** and **sugar** through the sauce. Add the **chicken** and its juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling. Pour in the water to thin out the sauce, if needed.
    7. Garnish with cilantro (coriander) and serve.
