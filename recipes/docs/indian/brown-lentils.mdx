# Lentils

:::info
There are many types of lentils and some substitutions can be made. Cooking can be done on stovetop or with instant pot.
:::

:::info
This recipe uses brown lentils (Whole Masoor Dal), as well as their hulled (red dal) and split (split red dal) forms. 
The whole dal retain their consistency, and the hulled and split dal thicken the gravy. Both are recommended to be used.
Some substitutes for the whole dal can be done, I have used whole mung beans (Green Moong Dal) as a replacement, and any split dal can be used instead of the split red dal.
:::

```mdx title="Ingredients - Brown & Red Lentils"
1 cup whole masoor dal (brown lentils)
1 cup split masoor dal (hulled and split brown lentils aka red lentils)
```

```mdx title="Ingredients - Chana Masala Gravy"
1 cup onion (finely chopped)
1 1/2 cups medium tomatoes (finely chopped)

1 tbsp cumin seeds
1 tbsp fennel seeds (optional)
3 dried red chilies or 1/2 tsp chili flakes

1 tablespoon minced ginger
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/4 cup coriander leaves/cilantro with tender stalks, leave some to garnish

1/4 tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp sea salt, adjust to taste
1 tsp kashmiri chili powder, adjust to taste
1 tsp coriander powder (optional)
1/2 tsp cumin powder (optional)
1 tsp garam masala, adjust to taste

1 tbsp amchur powder
1 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi)
```

```mdx title="Instructinos - Lentil Preparation"
1. Add each type of lentil individually to a large bowl and rinse well at least 3x.
2. Add to a pot with 4 cups water if using both types of lentils, 3 cups if not using split lentils.
3. Bring to a rolling boil, skimming froth if it appears.
4. Reduce to medium and cook until tender, for 20-25 mins. Red lentils should break down completely and brown lentils to retain their shape.
```

```md title="Instructions - Gravy"
1. On a medium flame, head 2/3 tbsp ghee/oil in large pot.
2. When medium hot, add cumin and fennel seeds followed by dried red chilis. If using chili flakes save for a later step.
3. Once sizzling and the chilis turn crisp but not burnt, add onions. Sautee until light golden for 5-6 mins.
4. Stir in ginger garlic and coriander leaves/stems. Sautee until aromatic for 1-2 mins.
5. Stir in turmeric, salt, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and garam masala.
6. Add tomatoes and deglaze by pouring 1/4 cup water.
7. Cook until tomatoes break down completely.
8. Add cooked lentils along with the liquid in the pot and mix well. Pour hot water as needed (about 1/2 cup or as needed) and bring to boil.
9. Simmer for 5 minutes until thick and traces of fats visible on top. Optionally mash lentils a bit for a creamier consistency.
10. Stir in amchur poweder and fenugreek leaves.
