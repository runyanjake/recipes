    **Palak/Spinach Preparation**
    1. For best results separate stems as they may leave a bitter taste, or use baby spinach.
    2. Rinse and drain spinach. Leave as little water as possible as spinach will be cooked in oil.
    3. Heat 1/2 tsp oil in a pan. Saute green chilies, cashews, and spinach for 3-4 mins until the leaves thoroughly wilt and the raw smell of spinach has gone away. Alternatively, blanch the palak in 4 cups of ot water with 1/4 tsp salt for 2 mins, then immerse in ice cold water, and drain completely.
    4. Cool this and blend along with 1/4 cup water to a smooth puree. The smoother the better, as the cashews may leave a gritty texture if not fully emulsified. Add additional water if needed.

    **Gravy Instructions**
    1. (optinal) Heat 1 tablespoon butter and half tablespoon oil to the same pan. Once melted, add cumin seeds, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves until they begin to sizzle.
    2. Add the onions and fry until they turn transparent to golden.
    3. Saute ginger garlic paste for 1-2 minutes or until aromatic.
    4. Add tomatoes and salt. Saute uncovered until the tomatoes break down completely.
    5. Add garam masala and saute until the masala smells good, about 2 mins. 
    6. Pour 3/4 cup water and cook covered until onions are completely soft.
    7. (optional) For a smooth curry blend the gravy mixture.
    8. Lower the flame. Add kasuri methi and the pureed spinach. Mix well and cook until it begins to bubble for a few minutes. If too thick, add a few tablespoons of water.
    9. Add paneer and mix well. Optionally garnish with cream.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Keep it Healthy">
      <p>It really doesn't need it, but you can add heavy whipping cream to thicken the gravy. However it should be relatively thick as is.</p>
