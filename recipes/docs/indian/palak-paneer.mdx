    **Palak/Spinach Preparation**
    1. Bring a pot of enough water to cover the eggs to a boil once added.
    2. Place saucepan over high heat and add vinegar to help with peeling. Bring to a boil.
    3. Prick a hole in the wide end of each egg (helps with shape and peeling).
    4. Gently lower the eggs into the water.
    5. Set a timer for 6-7 minutes, depending on the target consistency.
    6. Pick out the eggs and set into cold or ice water.
    7. Peel shells and lower into the marinade. 
    8. Chill 1-4 (or more) hours.
    9. When serving, remove from marinade and cut in half.

    **Gravy Instructions**
    1. (optinal) Heat 1 tablespoon butter and half tablespoon oil to the same pan. Once melted, add cumin seeds, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves until they begin to sizzle.
    2. Add the onions and fry until they turn transparent to golden.
    3. Saute ginger garlic paste for 1-2 minutes or until aromatic.
    4. Add tomatoes and salt. Saute uncovered until the tomatoes break down completely.
    5. Add garam masala and saute until the masala smells good, about 2 mins. 
    6. Pour 3/4 cup water and cook covered until onions are completely soft.
    7. (optional) For a smooth curry blend the gravy mixture.
    8. Lower the flame. Add kasuri methi and the pureed spinach. Mix well and cook until it begins to bubble for a few minutes. If too thick, add a few tablespoons of water.
    9. Add paneer and mix well. Optionally garnish with cream.

    <Admonition type="info" title="Keep it Healthy">
      <p>It really doesn't need it, but you can add heavy whipping cream to thicken the gravy. However it should be relatively thick as is.</p>
