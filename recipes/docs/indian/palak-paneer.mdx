# Palak Paneer

:::info
If using canned tomatoes, you'll typically have enough to double the recipe which is a good amount to have some leftovers.
:::

```mdx title="Ingredients"
1 1/4 cups paneer
4 cups palak/spinach
2 tbsp oil (can use half oil half butter)
2 green chilies (deseeded)
3/4 cup onions, finely chopped
1/2 cup tomatoes
3/4 tsp ginger garlic paste
1/2 tsp salt
8-10 cashews
3/4 tsp garam masala
1/2 tsp kasuri methi
1/4 cup water (for blending with spinach)
3/4 cup water (to cook with gravy)
3 tbsp cream (optional)
1/8 tps cumin seeds (optional)
2 green cadamoms (optional)
1 inch cinnamon (optional)
2 cloves (optional)
```

```md title="Instructions - Palak"
1. For best results separate stems as they may leave a bitter taste, or use baby spinach.
2. Rinse and drain spinach. Leave as little water as possible as spinach will be cooked in oil.
3. Heat 1/2 tsp oil in a pan. Saute green chilies, cashews, and spinach for 3-4 mins until the leaves thoroughly wilt and the raw smell of spinach has gone away. Alternatively, blanch the palak in 4 cups of ot water with 1/4 tsp salt for 2 mins, then immerse in ice cold water, and drain completely.
4. Cool this and blend along with 1/4 cup water to a smooth puree. The smoother the better, as the cashews may leave a gritty texture if not fully emulsified. Add additional water if needed.
```

```md title="Instructions - Gravy"
1. (optinal) Heat 1 tablespoon butter and half tablespoon oil to the same pan. Once melted, add cumin seeds, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves until they begin to sizzle.
2. Add the onions and fry until they turn transparent to golden.
3. Saute ginger garlic paste for 1-2 minutes or until aromatic.
4. Add tomatoes and salt. Saute uncovered until the tomatoes break down completely.
5. Add garam masala and saute until the masala smells good, about 2 mins. 
6. Pour 3/4 cup water and cook covered until onions are completely soft.
7. (optional) For a smooth curry blend the gravy mixture.
8. Lower the flame. Add kasuri methi and the pureed spinach. Mix well and cook until it begins to bubble for a few minutes. If too thick, add a few tablespoons of water.
9. Add paneer and mix well. Optionally garnish with cream.
```

### Notes
It really doesn't need it, but you can add heavy whipping cream to thicken the gravy. However it should be relatively thick as is.
