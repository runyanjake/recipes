# Chana Masala

:::info
Match the chana amount correctly, or the gravy gets very thin.
:::

```mdx title="Ingredients - Chana"
1 cup dry chana (raw chickpeas) or 3 cups soaked/2 15 oz cans
1 1/2 cups water, more for gravy
```

```mdx title="Ingredients - Chana Masala Gravy"
2 tablespoons oil
1 small bay leaf (optional)
1 inch cinnamon (optional)
2 cloves (optional)
2 green cardimoms (optional)
1 1/2 cups (2 large) finely chopped onion
1 green chili (optional)
1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste
1 1/2 cups finely chopped tomatoes
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1 1/2 teaspoons kashmiri red chili powder
1 teaspon garam masala 
2 teaspoon coriander powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin powder (optional)
1 teaspoon kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves, optional)
1/4 teaspoon amchur (dry mango powder, optional)
2 tbsp finely chopped coriander leaves/cilantro
```

```md title="Instructions - Chana Preparation"
1. Rinse dried chickpeas at least 3 times to remove loose skin. Soak in 3 1/2 to 4 cups water overnight for at least 8 hours. Additionally you can add a small amount of baking soda to loosen the chana skins. 
2. Drain water and rinse well. Optionally seperate skins from chana (but keep them later to thicken sauce). Pour the recipe water in and pressure cook for 5 to 6 minutes on a stovetop or 18 minutes on high pressure in an instant pot.
3. Check for tenderness. Fully cooked chickpeas should mash fully when squeezed. 
```

```md title="Instructions - Chana Masala - Stovetop"
1. Heat oil in a large pot. Add the whole spices - cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and bay leaf.
2. After they start to sizzle, add onions and green chili. Saute until they start to turn light golden. 
3. Add ginger garlic paste and saute for 1 minute, avoiding burning it.
4. Add tomatoes and salt. Cook until mushy, pulpy, and thick. 
5. Stir in red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, coriander powder, and cumin powder. Saute until fragrant, 3 to 4 minuts.
6. Optional - If looking for a smooth curry, discard the bay leaf, green chili and cinnamon. Blend in a blender. You can add 2 tablespoons of cooked chana for a thicker curry.
7. Add the chana with the chana stock (or replace with 1 1/4 cups of water if you added baking soda to chana while soaking). Pour an additional 3/4 to 1 cup water. If optional Step 7 was not taken, you do not need as much water.
8. Mix well, taste and add more salt. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
9. When consistency is thick, add amchur powder and kasuiri methi.
10. Garnish with coriander leaves, sprinkle lemon juice if desired.
```



```md title="Instructions - Chana Masala - Instant Pot"
- If cooking in the Instant pot, make the onion tomato masala on saute mode. 
- Optionally cool and blend. 
- Add soaked chickpeas with 2 cups water. Deglaze and pressure cook on high for 35 minutes. 
- After pressure drops, open the lid and cook on saute mode until thick. 
- Serve with kasuri methi and amchur. 

```
